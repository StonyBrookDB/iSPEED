Adrien Maglo and Clément Courbet

PPMC is the author implementation of the algorithm presented in the article "Progressive Compression of Surface Polygon Meshes". This software is released under the GPL v3 license (see COPYING).
Please note that this is research code. It is only provided as a proof of concept of the ideas described in the research paper. The quality and the performances of this program can certainly be improved.

1 - Compilation

PPMC compilation has only been tested on Linux. But it should be possible to compile it for other platforms.

The following dependencies are required for the compilation:
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- GLU
- CGAL

Once you have installed these libraries, go to the PPMC source directory and configure it using cmake:
$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
$ cmake ..

Then, compile:
$ make

2 - Execution

Display the usage message to learn how to use PPMC to compress and decompress meshes.
$ ./ppmc -h

The current version only supports the OFF format.
